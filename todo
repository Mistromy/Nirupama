# Todos
## Fix discord logging file limit
## Put all settings into /settings
## Fix all tools: react, tenor, etc
## Tenor tool should send a prompt like: i want a funny gif of someone falling, then cheap model looks for gifs, reads the image, and takes the best one
## Fix online status not changing back to yellow
## Mabye create something that uses embeds cuz why not


# Create AI Pipeline
## First cheap model reads message and decides what tools to use ####### OR selected model reads message and sends response with tool calls and parameters.
## Code filters thru response and runs tools if there are any.
## Feedback gets given back to ai if exists etc for search image, using cheapest model if possible.
## Ai response gets sent to user
### ...Writing message gets updated with currect status every time

# Make the ai be able to see ship pfps for ship
# allow it to change the result a bit
# feed the display name instead of username to ship command

# add update button to automatically git pull, and restart necessary cogs.
